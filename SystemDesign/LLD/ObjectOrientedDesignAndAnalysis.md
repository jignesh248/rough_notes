### The Object_Oriented Analysis and Design Project Lifecycle

#### 1. Make sure you software does what the customer wants it to do. 

##### a. Feature List 
- Figure out what your app is supposed to do at a high level.
- Your feature lists are all about understanding what your software is supposed to do.

##### b. Use case Diagrams 
- Nail dow the big processes that your app performs, and any external forces that are involved.
- Your use case diagrams let you start thinking about how your software will be used, without getting into a bunch of unnecessary details.

##### c. Break Up the Problem 
- Break your application up into modules of functionality, and then decide on an order in which to tackle each of your modules.

##### d. [Iterative] Requirements
 - Figure out the individual requirements for each module, and make sure those fit in with the big picture.

##### e. [Iterative] Domain Analysis 
- Figure out how your use cases map to objects in your app, and make sure your customer is on the same page as you are.

#### 2. Apply basic OO principles to add flexibility.

##### f. [Iterative] Preliminary Design
- Fill in details about your objects, define relationships between the objects, and apply pricinple and patterns.

#### 3. Strive for a maintainable reusable design.

##### g. [Iterative] Implementation
 - Write code, test it, and make sure it works. Do this for each behavior, each feature, each use case, each problem, until you're done.

##### h. Delivery 
- You're done! Release your software, submit your invoices and get paid.
